# Digital Product Design Skills Suite - DELIVERY SUMMARY

## What Was Created

I've created a complete suite of 4 specialized Claude skills for digital product design:

### ‚úÖ 1. Design - Research (`design-research/`)
- **Focus**: User research, personas, design principles, roadmaps
- **Methodology**: Jobs-to-be-Done framework
- **Outputs**: Markdown documents
- **Size**: ~2,100 words

### ‚úÖ 2. Design - Concepts (`design-concepts/`)
- **Focus**: Visual explorations, mood boards, prototypes
- **Methodology**: Divergent ideation ‚Üí convergent refinement
- **Outputs**: HTML/React artifacts, markdown docs
- **Size**: ~2,300 words

### ‚úÖ 3. Design - Production (`design-production/`)
- **Focus**: Production-ready specs, Figma files, design systems
- **Methodology**: Pixel-perfect, state-complete handoff
- **Outputs**: React prototypes, design specs, Figma files (via API), Lottie animations
- **Size**: ~2,800 words

### ‚úÖ 4. Design - QA (`design-qa/`)
- **Focus**: Implementation validation, issue tracking
- **Methodology**: Systematic review against specifications
- **Outputs**: QA reports (markdown), issue tracking (CSV)
- **Size**: ~2,700 words

### ‚úÖ 5. Suite Documentation (`README.md`)
- Overview of all skills
- Usage examples
- Integration patterns
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows the agreed-upon format:

1. **Core Methodology** (detailed) - The "how" of the approach
2. **Tool Usage Patterns** (very detailed) - Specific workflows with examples
3. **Quality Criteria** (detailed) - What makes outputs excellent
4. **Examples** (selective) - Concrete examples of good vs. poor work
5. **Common Pitfalls** (detailed) - Things to avoid

Total: **~10,000 words** of comprehensive design methodology

## Key Features

### ‚ú® Standalone but Integrated
- Each skill works independently
- Skills reference each other when helpful
- Loose coupling allows flexibility

### ‚ú® PM Suite Awareness
- Compatible terminology and formats
- Integration hooks for coordination
- Ready to optimize during pilot project

### ‚ú® Production-Ready
- Comprehensive enough for immediate use
- Detailed enough to guide behavior
- Flexible enough to adapt to your needs

### ‚ú® Best Practices Encoded
- Jobs-to-be-Done methodology
- Design system thinking
- Accessibility considerations
- Developer handoff excellence
- Systematic QA approach

## How to Use

### Option 1: Upload to Claude.ai
1. Go to Claude.ai
2. Enable code execution and skills
3. Upload each skill folder (drag & drop)
4. Start using: "Use design-research to create personas from this data"

### Option 2: Claude Code CLI
```bash
# Install skills from directory
/plugin add /path/to/design-research
/plugin add /path/to/design-concepts
/plugin add /path/to/design-production
/plugin add /path/to/design-qa

# Skills auto-activate when relevant
```

### Option 3: Claude API
- Upload via Skills API endpoint
- Reference in your custom applications
- See Anthropic Skills API docs

## Quick Test

Try this to verify installation:

```
"I'm designing a checkout flow for an e-commerce app. 
Use design-research to outline what research we should do."
```

Expected: Claude reads design-research/SKILL.md and provides a research plan following Jobs-to-be-Done methodology.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Review the README.md for full documentation
2. ‚úÖ Upload skills to your Claude environment
3. ‚úÖ Test with a small project or feature

### Pilot Project
- Use skills on a real design project
- Document what works well vs. what needs adjustment
- Note any gaps or unclear instructions
- Track integration patterns with PM suite

### Iteration Opportunities
Based on pilot project learnings:
- Adjust methodology details
- Add company-specific examples
- Fine-tune deliverable formats
- Strengthen PM suite integration
- Add new skills if needed (accessibility, design systems, etc.)

## Integration Points Prepared

### With PM Suite (Loose Coupling)
- ‚úÖ Compatible terminology (user stories, features, sprints)
- ‚úÖ Markdown output formats for easy integration
- ‚úÖ Awareness of PM contexts in skills
- ‚úÖ Ready to tighten integration during pilot

### With Design Tools
- ‚úÖ Figma API integration (design-production)
- ‚úÖ Web analysis capabilities (all skills)
- ‚úÖ Standard file formats (HTML, React, Lottie)

### With Engineering
- ‚úÖ Developer-friendly specifications
- ‚úÖ Complete state documentation
- ‚úÖ Accessibility requirements
- ‚úÖ Technical constraints consideration

## Questions Answered

From our conversation:

‚úÖ **Should skills reference each other?**
Yes, but can work independently if references missing

‚úÖ **What level of detail?**
Medium-high (1,500-2,500 words per skill) with room for iteration

‚úÖ **File formats?**
- Personas: Markdown
- Prototypes: HTML/React
- Animations: Lottie
- Design systems: From scratch or provided

‚úÖ **Methodology?**
Jobs-to-be-Done for research

‚úÖ **QA Standards?**
Reference design files and brand guidelines (separate WCAG skill possible)

‚úÖ **Integration with PM suite?**
Loose coupling for now, optimize during pilot

## Support

If you have questions:
1. Check the README.md
2. Review individual SKILL.md files
3. Look at examples in each skill
4. Test with small requests first

## What Makes These Skills Different

Compared to generic design prompts:

‚úÖ **Systematic methodology** encoded
‚úÖ **Quality criteria** clearly defined
‚úÖ **Common pitfalls** explicitly avoided
‚úÖ **Tool orchestration** patterns included
‚úÖ **Real deliverable formats** specified
‚úÖ **Integration hooks** prepared
‚úÖ **Best practices** from trial and error

## Success Metrics

Skills are working well when:
- Outputs require minimal editing
- Designers trust the recommendations
- Developers can implement without questions
- Stakeholders understand the artifacts
- Quality is consistent across projects

## Final Notes

These skills represent comprehensive design methodology distilled into Claude-optimized formats. They're ready to use immediately but designed to improve through iteration.

The **medium-high detail level** strikes a balance:
- Detailed enough to guide behavior
- Flexible enough to adapt to context
- Focused enough to avoid cognitive overload

Looking forward to hearing how the pilot project goes!

# Design Concepts Phase - Summary

**Project**: Design Dashboard
**Phase**: Concepts
**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Deliverables**: 3 (Mood Board + 2 Wireframes)

---

## Overview

The concepts phase translated research insights into tangible visual direction and layout patterns. Following the design-concepts skill methodology, we created:

1. **Mood Board** - Visual direction and design language
2. **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity layouts for key views

This work validates our approach before moving to high-fidelity production specs.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Mood Board (`mood-board.md`)

**Purpose**: Establish visual direction and design language

**Key Decisions**:
- **Dark mode first**: Black backgrounds (#0a0a0a, #1a1a1a) for reduced eye strain
- **Color palette**: Neutral grays with blue accent (#2563eb) for interactive elements
- **Typography**: Inter font family with clear type scale (48px ‚Üí 12px)
- **Spacing system**: 8px base unit for consistency
- **Layout**: 1400px max-width content areas with 24px gutters

**Inspiration Sources**:
- **Linear**: Speed, clarity, minimal chrome
- **Notion**: Flexible content organization
- **Storybook**: Component documentation patterns
- **Figma**: Design-tool-first thinking

**Why these choices**: Research showed users need fast scanning (speed), visual content display (flexibility), and design-focused interface (tool aesthetic).

### 2. Projects List Wireframe (`wireframe-projects-list.html`)

**Purpose**: Layout for browsing all design projects

**Key Features**:
- **Sidebar navigation** (240px fixed) with project counts
- **Phase filters** for focusing on specific workflow stages
- **Project cards** in responsive grid (400px min-width)
- **Status badges** color-coded by phase (Research/Concepts/Production/QA)
- **Metadata display**: Deliverable count, last updated date

**Design Principles Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Status Transparency**: Phase badges and updated dates prominent
- ‚úÖ **Summaries with Easy Depth**: Card shows summary, click for details
- ‚úÖ **Design Work is Storytelling**: Projects organized by phase

**What we validated**:
- Grid layout works for multiple projects
- Status is immediately visible
- Filtering by phase supports different user workflows

### 3. Project Detail Wireframe (`wireframe-project-detail.html`)

**Purpose**: Deep view into a single project with all context

**Key Features**:
- **Context-first layout**: Principles and insights above deliverables
- **Tabbed navigation**: Overview / All Deliverables / Activity
- **Collapsible sections**: Show summaries, expand for depth
- **Visual previews**: Color palettes and wireframe thumbnails inline
- **Deliverable cards**: With skill badges, summaries, and view buttons

**Design Principles Applied**:
- ‚úÖ **Context Before Details**: Goals/principles/insights displayed first
- ‚úÖ **Summaries with Easy Depth**: 3 of 5 principles shown, "Show All" button
- ‚úÖ **Visual Content is Critical**: Inline previews for visual deliverables
- ‚úÖ **Design-Focused**: PM/Engineering links relegated to footer

**What we validated**:
- Collapsible sections allow progressive disclosure
- Visual previews make design work scannable
- Context sections don't overwhelm deliverables list

---

## Key Insights from Concepts Phase

### Insight 1: Visual Hierarchy Matters More Than We Thought

The wireframes revealed that without clear visual hierarchy, users would struggle to find context (principles, insights) before jumping to deliverables. We intentionally made context sections **larger and more prominent** than deliverables.

### Insight 2: Interactive HTML > Static Images

Building wireframes as interactive HTML (vs. static mockups) let us validate:
- Hover states and transitions
- Click interactions and navigation
- Responsive behavior at different widths
- Actual typography and spacing values

### Insight 3: Color Palette Needs to Support Visual Content

The mood board process revealed our color palette must be **neutral enough** to not compete with colorful mood boards, wireframes, and mockups displayed inline. Dark grays with minimal saturation achieve this.

### Insight 4: Footer Links Solve PM Integration

Research suggested PM dashboard shouldn't be prominent (Principle 4 update). Wireframes validated that **footer links** provide context without distracting from design focus.

## Design Validation

### What Works Well ‚úÖ

1. **Dark mode aesthetic** - Reduces eye strain, feels professional
2. **Sidebar navigation** - Familiar pattern, easy to orient
3. **Card-based layouts** - Scannable, flexible, responsive
4. **Inline visual previews** - Solves "visual content is critical" insight
5. **Progressive disclosure** - Summaries with expand options prevent overwhelm

### What Needs Production Refinement üîÑ

1. **Interaction patterns** - Hover states, animations, transitions need spec
2. **Responsive breakpoints** - Mobile/tablet layouts need definition
3. **Loading states** - What happens while data loads?
4. **Empty states** - What if project has no deliverables yet?
5. **Error states** - What if file can't be loaded?

### What We're Not Sure About Yet ‚ùì

1. **Deliverable filtering** - Should detail view allow filtering by skill/phase?
2. **Visual preview size** - Is 240px height right for inline previews?
3. **Timeline view** - Does "Activity" tab need its own wireframe?

## Alignment with Design Principles

| Principle | How Wireframes Embody It |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Context Before Details** | Principles/insights sections placed above deliverables |
| **Summaries with Easy Depth** | Cards show summaries, "View File" for depth |
| **Status Transparency** | Phase badges, last updated dates prominent |
| **Design-Focused** | PM links in footer only, visual previews emphasized |
| **Design Work is Storytelling** | Deliverables grouped by skill/phase, chronological |

## Next Steps ‚Üí Production Phase

The concepts phase validated our approach. Now we move to design-production to create:

1. **High-fidelity prototype** (React/Lit components)
2. **Complete design specification** (all states, interactions, responsive)
3. **Design system tokens** (colors, typography, spacing as variables)
4. **Animation specifications** (timing, easing, motion patterns)
5. **Developer handoff documentation** (implementation notes)

**Key questions for production**:
- What component library/framework? (Brief says Vite + Lit)
- Real data integration or mock data for prototype?
- Do we build full dashboard or just key views?
- What's the deployment plan for prototype?

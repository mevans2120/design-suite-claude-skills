## Persona 1: Sarah - Lead Designer

**Demographics**:
- Age: 32-42
- Location: Tech hub city

**Jobs-to-be-Done**:
- **Functional**: Review design work across multiple projects, track design decisions, ensure consistency across team output
- **Emotional**: Feel confident all design work meets quality bar and demonstrates value
- **Social**: Demonstrate design value and impact to leadership

**Context & Triggers**:
Sarah needs to prepare for leadership reviews, onboard new designers, or ensure design consistency across projects. She's triggered when stakeholders ask "what's the design direction?" or when she needs to audit quality across the team.

**Pain Points**:
- Design deliverables scattered across folders with no unified view
- Can't quickly see what design work is happening across projects
- Loses track of research insights and design rationale
- Spends time hunting for specific artifacts when stakeholders ask questions
- Design decisions get lost or forgotten over time

**Goals & Motivations**:
- Maintain oversight without micromanaging
- Ensure design quality and consistency
- Demonstrate design impact to executives
- Enable team to work autonomously

**Behaviors & Preferences**:
- Reviews design work weekly
- Prefers visual summaries over detailed documentation
- Needs quick access to design rationale
- Values centralized, organized information

**Dashboard Job**: "Show me all active design work and key decisions at a glance"

**Quote**:
> "I need to know what design work is happening without constantly asking my team. When leadership asks about our design direction, I should be able to answer confidently."

- **Emotional**: Feel confident implementation matches design intent
- **Social**: Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth with designers

**Context & Triggers**:
Jen is implementing features during development sprints. She's triggered when she encounters edge cases, needs to understand spacing/colors, or wants to validate her implementation matches specs.

**Pain Points**:
- Hunts for relevant specs during implementation
- Unclear which design file is the "source of truth"
- Needs to ask designers about edge cases
- Can't find design rationale for implementation questions
- Back-and-forth slows down development

**Goals & Motivations**:
- Implement designs accurately and efficiently
- Minimize blockers during development
- Understand design intent, not just visual specs
- Build confidence in implementation decisions

**Behaviors & Preferences**:
- References design specs multiple times during implementation
- Needs precise technical details (spacing, colors, states)
- Values comprehensive documentation
- Prefers self-service over interrupting designers

**Dashboard Job**: "Show me what I need to build and where to find details"

**Quote**:
> "I just want to know: what's the approved design, where are the specs, and why did we make this choice? Then I can build it without constantly asking questions."

## Summary

**Primary Personas**: Sarah (Lead Designer), Marcus (Product Manager), Jen (Software Engineer), Alex (Executive)

**Distribution**: All personas are equally important for Phase 1 success. Dashboard must serve all four use cases.

**Key Insights Across Personas**:
1. **Visibility Gap**: All personas struggle with design work being "invisible" until explicitly shared
2. **Context is Critical**: Everyone needs "why" behind design decisions, not just "what"
3. **Self-Service**: Users want to find information themselves without interrupting designers
4. **Appropriate Detail**: Different personas need different levels of detail (exec summary vs. technical specs)
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Confusion about which artifacts are current and authoritative

**Design Implications**:
- Dashboard must surface both high-level summaries and deep details
- Design rationale should be prominent and accessible
- Clear visual hierarchy to guide different user types to relevant information
- Status and recency indicators essential for trust
- Progressive disclosure: summaries with easy access to details

# Current Project Status

## Overview
Design Suite with 4 skills (research, concepts, production, qa) for complete design workflow from research to implementation.

## Current Focus
**Design Dashboard architectural review completed - Ready for Next.js implementation**

## Recent Changes

### Architectural Review & Tech Stack Decision (2025-10-23)

**Key Decision: Switch to Next.js + React + Tailwind**
- Reviewed feature list and architectural decisions with technical-architecture framework
- Decided to switch from Vite + Lit to Next.js 14+ (App Router) + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Created comprehensive architectural review document
- Created ADR-001 documenting tech stack decision with rationale
- All 10 critical questions answered and documented

**Critical Decisions Made:**
1. **Internal developer tool** - Static JSON data, no authentication needed
2. **File storage** - < 100 files, commit to `/public/outputs/`
3. **No search/filtering** - Only phase filtering (DD-13)
4. **Desktop/tablet focus** - Mobile not a priority
5. **Performance reasonable** - No strict Lighthouse requirements
6. **Out of scope** - Project creation UI, activity tabs (specs coming later)

**Documents Created:**
- `ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md` - Full architectural analysis and recommendations
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-nextjs-tech-stack.md` - Architecture Decision Record
- `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step Phase 1 implementation guide
- `verify-skills.sh` - Symlink health check script

**Phase Reorganization:**
- Original: 4 phases over 4 weeks
- Updated: 6 phases over 7 weeks (moved accessibility earlier)

**Tech Stack Updates:**
- Updated `design-dashboard-registry.csv` PROJECT_META with Next.js stack
- Created implementation roadmap with code examples

### Symlink Health Check (2025-10-23)
- Created `verify-skills.sh` to detect broken symlinks
- Updated installation documentation with troubleshooting
- Added dev-suite and project-suite skills to project (.claude/skills/)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude external skill symlinks
- All 4 design skills verified healthy and in sync

### Feature Extraction Completed (2025-10-22)
- Extracted 33 features from design-dashboard specs and wireframes
- Created `design-dashboard-registry.csv` with dependencies, priorities, phases, and visual references
- Generated roadmaps (Markdown/HTML/JSON) using project-planner's RoadmapExporter
- Created `design-dashboard-data.js` for dashboard integration with visualRef and specRef links
- All 4 design skills installed globally in `~/.claude/skills/`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Start)
1. Create Next.js project: `npx create-next-app@latest design-dashboard`
2. Install shadcn/ui and configure Tailwind
3. Convert design tokens to Tailwind config
4. Implement root layout with sidebar
5. Build projects list view
6. Build project detail view

### Short-term (Phase 1-2)
- Complete Phase 1: Foundation & MVP (Weeks 1-2)
- Complete Phase 2A: Core Components (Week 3)
- Complete Phase 2B: Enhanced Content (Week 4)

### Long-term
- Phase 2C: Accessibility Foundation (Week 5)
- Phase 3: Responsive & States (Week 6)
- Phase 4: Polish & Animation (Week 7)

## Technology Stack

**Design Dashboard:**
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- UI Library: React 18+
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Components: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- Data: Static JSON files
- Deployment: Vercel (static export)
- TypeScript: Yes

**Rationale:** Optimized for AI-assisted development with extensive training data and tooling.

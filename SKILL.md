# Design - Research

This skill guides Claude through comprehensive UX research processes using Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) methodology to understand user needs, behaviors, and contexts that inform design decisions.

## Core Methodology

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework
Every research activity focuses on understanding what "job" users are hiring a product to do. Research uncovers:
- **Functional jobs**: The practical tasks users need to accomplish
- **Emotional jobs**: How users want to feel or avoid feeling
- **Social jobs**: How users want to be perceived by others
- **Context**: The circumstances that trigger the job

### Research Process
1. **Scoping & Planning**: Define research questions, identify what needs to be learned
2. **Data Collection**: Gather existing data (analytics, support tickets, reviews) and plan new research
3. **Analysis**: Identify patterns, pain points, and opportunities using JTBD lens
4. **Synthesis**: Create actionable artifacts (personas, principles, roadmaps)
5. **Validation**: Test assumptions and refine understanding

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Initial Information Gathering
**Step 1: Inventory Available Resources**
Before starting research, Claude should:
```
1. Ask user what materials they have:
   - Existing user data (analytics, surveys, interviews)
   - Competitor research or industry reports
   - Current product/website/app to review
   - Business requirements or constraints

2. Use `view` to check uploaded files
3. Use `web_search` for industry trends and competitor analysis
4. Use `web_fetch` to analyze competitor websites and apps
```

**Step 2: Create Research Plan**
Document what needs to be learned and how:
```markdown
# Research Plan
## Research Questions
- What jobs are users trying to accomplish?
- What are current pain points and workarounds?
- What contexts trigger the need for this solution?

## Data Sources
- [ ] Analytics review (if provided)
- [ ] User interviews (plan discussion guide)
- [ ] Competitor analysis
- [ ] Industry trend research

## Timeline & Deliverables
```

### Data Analysis Workflow
When reviewing user data:
1. **Quantitative First**: Look at analytics, usage data, conversion metrics
   - Use `view` to read CSV/Excel files
   - Create summary analysis in markdown
   - Identify behavioral patterns

2. **Qualitative Second**: Review interviews, support tickets, reviews
   - Extract direct user quotes (always cite source)
   - Identify recurring themes
   - Map to JTBD framework

3. **Competitive Analysis**: Research how others solve similar jobs
   - Use `web_search` for competitors: "best [category] apps 2025"
   - Use `web_fetch` to analyze specific competitor sites
   - Screenshot key interactions (if user provides URLs)
   - Document strengths/weaknesses relative to user jobs

### Creating Discussion Guides
For planning user research studies:
```markdown
# User Interview Discussion Guide

## Introduction (5 min)
- Thank participant
- Explain purpose and format
- Get consent to record

## Context Questions (10 min)
[Ask about their current situation and job-to-be-done]
- Walk me through the last time you [relevant activity]
- What triggered you to start looking for a solution?
- What alternatives have you tried?

## Deep Dive (30 min)
[Focus on specific jobs and contexts]
- What would make this task easier/faster/better?
- What's frustrating about current solutions?
- What would success look like?

## Closing (5 min)
- Anything else important we should know?
- Thank participant
```

## Quality Criteria

### Excellent Personas Include:
- **Name and photo** (AI-generated or stock image)
- **Demographics**: Age, location, role (only if relevant to JTBD)
- **Jobs to be done**: 3-5 primary jobs they're trying to accomplish
- **Pain points**: Current struggles and workarounds (with real quotes)
- **Goals & motivations**: What success looks like for them
- **Context**: When/where they experience the need
- **Tech comfort level**: Relevant for product complexity decisions

**Avoid**: Generic personas that don't tie to specific jobs, fictional fluff that doesn't inform design decisions

### Excellent Design Principles:
- **Specific to the project**: Not generic ("be simple"), but contextual ("Prioritize speed over options for first-time setup")
- **Actionable**: Designers can use them to make decisions
- **Tied to research insights**: Each principle comes from user data
- **Memorable**: Short, clear, possibly with a tagline
- **3-7 principles**: Enough to guide, not so many they're ignored

**Example Format**:
```markdown
## Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Over Feature Parity
*Show what users need now, not everything we can do*
**Insight**: 73% of users abandoned setup because they felt overwhelmed by options they didn't understand yet.

### 2. Forgiveness Over Prevention
*Make it easy to undo, not hard to do wrong*
**Insight**: Users expressed anxiety about "breaking things" - they want to explore confidently.
```

### Excellent Customer Segments:
- **Behavioral-based**: Grouped by how they use product, not just demographics
- **JTBD-aligned**: Each segment has distinct primary jobs
- **Sized**: Approximate % of user base (if data available)
- **Named meaningfully**: "Power Users" not "Segment A"
- **Actionable**: Each segment suggests different design approaches

### Excellent Design Roadmaps:
- **Insight-driven**: Each initiative ties to research finding
- **Prioritized**: Uses framework (Impact/Effort, RICE, etc.)
- **Timeline**: Realistic phases (Discovery → Concept → Build)
- **Success metrics**: How we'll know if it worked
- **Dependencies noted**: What needs to happen first

## Deliverable Formats

### Personas
**File**: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/personas.md`
**Format**: Markdown with clear sections for each persona
**Include**: Photo/avatar, quote, jobs-to-be-done, pain points, goals, context

### Customer Segments  
**File**: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/customer-segments.md`
**Format**: Markdown table + detailed descriptions
**Include**: Segment name, size, primary jobs, characteristics, design implications

### Design Principles
**File**: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/design-principles.md`
**Format**: Markdown with principle + insight + example
**Include**: 3-7 principles, each with rationale from research

### Design Roadmap
**File**: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/design-roadmap.md`
**Format**: Markdown with timeline visualization
**Include**: Prioritized initiatives, rationale, timeline, success metrics

### Research Discussion Guide
**File**: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/research-discussion-guide.md`
**Format**: Markdown with timing and question flow
**Include**: Sections for intro, context, deep dive, closing

## Examples

### Good Research Question Progression
❌ **Poor**: "What do users want?"
✅ **Better**: "What job are users hiring our checkout for, and what's preventing them from completing it?"

❌ **Poor**: "Is the UI confusing?"  
✅ **Better**: "At what point in the flow do users get stuck, and what are they trying to accomplish when it happens?"

### Good Persona Example (Excerpt)
```markdown
## Sarah Chen - The Efficiency Seeker

![Photo: Professional woman, 30s, laptop]

> "I need to get in, get my answer, and get back to my actual work. Every extra click costs me time I don't have."

**Role**: Marketing Manager at mid-size SaaS company
**Primary Jobs**:
1. Quickly generate reports for stakeholder meetings (weekly)
2. Compare campaign performance across channels (daily)
3. Identify trending content topics (monthly)

**Pain Points**:
- Current tool requires 8 clicks to get to the data she needs
- Switching between multiple dashboards wastes 15+ minutes per session
- Can't customize views, so she recreates the same reports manually

**Success Looks Like**: 
"Open app, see my key metrics immediately, export what I need in under 2 minutes."
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Research Without Clear Questions
**Problem**: Gathering data without knowing what decisions it should inform
**Instead**: Start with "What do we need to decide?" then ask "What must we learn to decide?"

### ❌ Personas That Are Just Demographics
**Problem**: "Sarah, 34, lives in Seattle, likes yoga" tells designers nothing useful
**Instead**: Focus on jobs, contexts, pain points, and goals that inform design decisions

### ❌ Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Spending weeks analyzing data without creating actionable insights
**Instead**: Set a timebox, create initial insights, plan to validate and refine

### ❌ Ignoring Negative Data
**Problem**: Only highlighting findings that support existing assumptions
**Instead**: Actively look for disconfirming evidence and edge cases

### ❌ Generic Design Principles
**Problem**: Principles like "Be simple" or "User-friendly" that could apply to anything
**Instead**: Create specific principles tied to your research insights and project context

### ❌ Creating Artifacts That Don't Get Used
**Problem**: Beautiful personas that sit in a deck and never inform decisions
**Instead**: Make artifacts scannable, actionable, and reference them in design reviews

### ❌ Skipping Context
**Problem**: Understanding what users do without understanding when/why
**Instead**: Always ask about the circumstances that trigger the job-to-be-done

### Related Skills
When users mention sprints, backlogs, or product requirements, consider that PM skills may be available to coordinate with.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always start by asking what the user already has** - don't recreate existing research
2. **Use real user quotes liberally** - they bring insights to life and build empathy
3. **Create visual representations** when possible - journey maps, flow diagrams
4. **Tie everything back to jobs-to-be-done** - this keeps research actionable
5. **Be specific about confidence levels** - note when insights need more validation
6. **Make artifacts scannable** - use headers, bullets, bold key insights
7. **Include "So what?"** - always answer why each insight matters for design

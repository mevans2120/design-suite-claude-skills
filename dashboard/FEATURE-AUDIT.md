2. **View File Button Path Resolution** - WORKING: Paths already correct for Next.js static export

### P1 - High (FIXED)
3. **Phase Filter Sidebar Links** - FIXED: Removed interactive styling (cursor-pointer, hover), added opacity-60 to indicate disabled state
4. **Footer Links** - FIXED: Converted to non-interactive divs with reduced opacity
